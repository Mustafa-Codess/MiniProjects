        <p>Md Fasi:<br><b>Rating:- &starf;&starf;&starf;&starf;&starf;</b><br>I had a very good experience with flight booking website. The customer service is really good. The customer 
            service representative sharan really did a great job by explaining everything and helped me a lot in chosing the best deal. They really care about their customers</p>

        <p>Md Bilal:<br><b>Rating:- &starf;&starf;&starf;&starf;</b><br>We booked a trip to Bankok through this website and saved lot of money. We read the reviews
             and knew going into it that if we needed to change our flight schedule it could be difficult. Thankfully we didn't have to do it and all of our flights came 
           through just fine. Thanks
